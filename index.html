			<p><em>So, what has happened all this year already?</em></p>

			<p>To answer simply, the project had reached a stall and to make it alive again, the OD artists requested a new Windows 32 snapshot to see what they could improve.
			Bertram first answered the call and tried for a few weeks to make it build and run again on Windows. Even if that guy had a hard time to make it compile at the time (and was rather a noob with such deps), it permitted to point out certain problems, such as the need to upgrade the dependencies and report certain compilation problems upstream.
			Paul and him then paired on this one and a first Win32 snapshot went online after a month or two.
			<br />Then, by getting familiar with the code and seeing it run, Bertram couldn't leave the project like that and started proposing patches to fix this and that, helped by oln, Paul and nido at the time.
			<br />But the actual momentum happened with the arrival of hwoarangmy, and soon after with Akien, who both helped coordinating the project, and for hwoarangmy, recoded half of it (and more changes to it are incoming). ;-)
			<br />While Danimal was improving the game models, eugeneloza was on the new minions beds, and Akien was on packaging stuff and Bertram was mainly on upgrading the GUI.
			<br />A lot of features, bugfixes and cleanups happened in very little time, when you think about it.</p>

			<p>Let's take a few lines to thank the cool team that gathered here and poured a lot of blood into the development evil cup to produce this. Hopefully, they will never realize all the foolishness it is to think they're leading the project while everybody knows Danimal is secretly pulling all the strings.
			<br />Development didn't go without brain damages, though. Bertram developed an unexplainable and pathetic fear for Big Knights, eugeneloza had to use his big voice, and Akien even had to start learning how to code.</p>

			<p>But a lot is also planned for 0.5.0 with almost completed addition of an actual Fog of war thanks to hwoarangmy, some work on the GUI, on the materials, on more rooms, on user settings support, etc.
			<br />If you're simply curious or better if you wanna help, test, or document the next version, feel free to have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/OpenDungeons/OpenDungeons/issues">issues on GitHub</a>, and get in touch!</p>

			<p>Some crazy guy willing to work on improving the visuals would be perfect but we'll always find a use for you, be it on testing, or down below the dungeon, tortured with some lava. ;-></p>

			<p>Have a dreadful year, my pathetic minions.</p>
